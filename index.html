                                    The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race
                                    known as the
                                    Chitauri. In exchange for
                                    obtaining the Tesseract,[c] a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other
                                    promises to provide Loki with an
                                    army to conquer Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D.,
                                    arrives at
                                    a remote research facility
                                    where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a team studying the Tesseract. It
                                    suddenly
                                    activates and opens a wormhole,
                                    allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and uses his scepter to
                                    enslave
                                    Selvig and other agents,
                                    including Clint Barton, to aid him.

                                    In response, Fury reactivates the "Avengers Initiative". Agent Natasha Romanoff
                                    travels to
                                    Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce
                                    Banner so he can trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury
                                    approaches
                                    Steve Rogers to discuss his
                                    knowledge of the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark so he can check
                                    Selvig's research. Loki is in
                                    Stuttgart, where Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract. This leads
                                    to a
                                    confrontation with Rogers,
                                    Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to
                                    S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother
                                    Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to
                                    Asgard.
                                    Stark and Rogers intervene,
                                    and Loki is imprisoned in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier.

                                    The Avengers disagree on how to approach Loki and become argumentative once they
                                    realize
                                    S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to use the
                                    Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction to use against hostile
                                    extraterrestrials.
                                    During the argument, Loki's
                                    agents attack the Helicarrier, and the stress causes Banner to transform into the
                                    Hulk.
                                    Stark and Rogers restart the
                                    damaged engine while Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff subdues
                                    Barton,
                                    freeing him from Loki's
                                    influence. Loki escapes after mortally wounding Coulson. Fury uses Coulson's
                                    subsequent
                                    death to motivate the Avengers
                                    to work together as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a generator Selvig built to
                                    open a
                                    wormhole above Stark Tower in
                                    New York City to bring his Chitauri fleet and start his invasion.

                                    Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk work together to protect New
                                    York from
                                    the Chitauri. The Hulk
                                    incapacitates Loki while Romanoff learns from Selvig, now freed from Loki's mind
                                    control,
                                    that Loki's scepter can shut
                                    down the generator. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end
                                    the
                                    invasion by launching a nuclear
                                    missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and flies it through the
                                    wormhole
                                    toward the Chitauri fleet.
                                    The missile destroys the Chitauri mothership and disables their forces on Earth.
                                    Stark
                                    becomes unconscious, and his suit
                                    loses power, leaving him freefalling towards Earth. The Avengers manage to
                                    resuscitate him,
                                    while Romanoff uses Loki's
                                    scepter to close the wormhole. In the aftermath, Thor transports an imprisoned Loki
                                    and the
                                    Tesseract to Asgard, where
                                    Loki will face Asgardian justice.
